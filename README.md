Extend it to include the design process of the high-fidelity prototype of your website (including all the versions until the final one).Pictures, interview notes, sketches and all artifacts generated through the design process (including the unsuccessful ones) must somehow fit into the narrative of the report. Figures must be properly referred to in the text. Some of these images will be close to the text, others in the appendix. The link to a testable website prototype should be somewhere in the rapport.Add introductions and discussions.
