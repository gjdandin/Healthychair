# Healthychair
High-fidelity web prototype of ADTS1600 project

Live version link:   https://gjdandin.github.io/Healthychair/pages/index

Find inspiration from the other groups' website prototypes. Use the gathered information to develop a high visual-fidelity (interactive, graphically accurate) version of your websites. Incorporate concepts of graphical design, intuitive interface design and navigation from this and other classes (web design). The prototype must be clickable.

Text, images and menus should have proper content (e.g., the mission statement should have the mission of your company, images should have people or product images, not place holders, animations should work, etc.) 
You are free to choose any tool of your preference (FX, InVision, Sketch, HTML/CSS, etc.).

5.2. Rewrite design process of your website.In this section you should, write the reviewed version of your description of your website from Oblig 2. Extend it to include the design process of the high-fidelity prototype of your website (including all the versions until the final one).Pictures, interview notes, sketches and all artifacts generated through the design process (including the unsuccessful ones) must somehow fit into the narrative of the report. Figures must be properly referred to in the text. Some of these images will be close to the text, others in the appendix. The link to a testable website prototype should be somewhere in the rapport.Add introductions and discussions.
